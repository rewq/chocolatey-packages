# .net SmokeTest for WindowsÂ®

.net SmokeTest is a Windows application that provides an interactive interface into any .net Assembly allowing you to smoke-test an API without writing a single line of code. Construct an instance, call a method and get or set a property or field of any class then view or "drill-down" into the result.

Use this version if you only have .net 2.0 installed on your system.
